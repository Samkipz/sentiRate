# Streamlit depends on Pillow. 9.4.0 was once wheel-friendly but
# on newer Python releases (3.13+) the wheel is missing and pip falls
# back to a source build that fails with a KeyError during setup.
# Use a more recent release that publishes prebuilt wheels for all
# supported interpreters.  See https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#history
#
# pin the minimum version so we don't accidentally regress later,
# but allow upgrades so patches/security fixes can be installed.

# altair 6+ drops v4 package; pin to <5 so Streamlit (1.x) can
# still import vegalite.v4.
# there’s no need for v5 features in this dashboard.
altair>=4.0.0,<5.0.0
joblib
# protobuf<=3.20.3  # old pin; kept for backwards compatibility in some environments
#                       but TensorFlow (if installed) requires a much newer version.
#                       You can remove the restriction entirely if you’re not
#                       constrained by legacy systems.
# tensorflow              # optional heavy dependency used only by LSTM/tokenizer
#                         and model training code.  The dashboard works without
#                         it; install locally when you need the extra features.
