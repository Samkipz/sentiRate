# Streamlit depends on Pillow. 9.4.0 was once wheel-friendly but
# on newer Python releases (3.13+) the wheel is missing and pip falls
# back to a source build that fails with a KeyError during setup.
# Use a more recent release that publishes prebuilt wheels for all
# supported interpreters.  See https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#history
#
# pin the minimum version so we don't accidentally regress later,
# but allow upgrades so patches/security fixes can be installed.
Pillow>=9.4.0,<11

# protobuf<=3.20.3  # old pin; kept for backwards compatibility in some environments
#                       but TensorFlow (if installed) requires a much newer version.
#                       You can remove the restriction entirely if you’re not
#                       constrained by legacy systems.
